## Project Overview

Imagine you're designing a smart assistant to help someone plan a birthday party. This assistant isn't just a search engineâ€”it needs to act on behalf of the user to get things done. The user provides details about the party they want to throw, and the assistant recommends and books the best options, explaining its choices along the way.

## Technologies Used

- **LangChain**: Framework for building AI applications.
- **Groq API**: For natural language processing.
- **Streamlit**: For creating a web interface.
- **Docker**: For containerization.
